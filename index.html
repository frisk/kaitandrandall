            <p class="lead">Most of you who know us know that we are a fun, sassy, sarcastic, loving couple. After only a year of dating it was pretty apparent that we would be spending the rest of our lives together…we know, we’re sappy. We both believe that all great relationships are based on the foundation of an amazing friendship, and since day one that is exactly what we have had.
  We met in 2010 on a houseboat trip in Shasta, California. We quickly realized that we had very much in common and it was a start of beautiful relationship that continues to grow.

            <p class="lead">The first day I met Randall I knew that we were going to have a great friendship. What I didn't know at the time was that our great friendship would turn into an amazing relationship. Our first weekend on the houseboat trip in Shasta is one that we still talk about on a regular basis. We were inseparable. I could't get enough of his smile and laugh and his infectious good attitude towards life. When the weekend came to a close I had was so sad, but I had this calm feeling of knowing that I would see him again soon. I was right.  Ever since that weekend, we have been tied to each others hips… not physically because we did long distance for two years (give or take), but that never stopped us from doing whatever it took to be with each other. I love him more than anything in this world. </p><em>I can't wait until September 13, 2014 when I finally get to call him my husband and start the rest of our lives together.</em>

            <p class="lead">I often imagined the perfect girl. She would hang out with me at the lake and we could waterski together. She loved to go camping, sleep outside under the stars, and didn't care about wearing makeup. She was naturally beautiful and completely stunning when she dressed up. She would grab my hand when we walked down the street, happy and confident in our relationship. She would get along well with my friends and family, and they would all adore her. She would irritate me just to get my attention and she had just enough attitude to always keep me on my toes. She would jam out with me on long road trips and love to be spontaneous. She would be my best friend.</p><em>This unbelievably perfect girl is Kaitlin Wade, my Wife to be.</em>

            <h4 class="wedding-topic">Leading Up</h4>
            <p class="lead">Planning for the proposal was the most terrifying experience of my life. I wanted the proposal to be nothing less than perfect. I initially thought that nothing would be more perfect than proposing to Kaitlin in Lake Shasta where we met. I had a great idea, but The window of opportunity was closing for coming up with a plan to get her to Shasta in the winter time without spoiling the surprise. Things got worse when Kaitlin overheard a Skype conversation with my boss and I. He said loud and clear "Did you propose?!" while I tried to divert and make light of the conversation he continued with "Well did you get the ring yet?". My face turned bright red and I was bombarded with questions from Kaitlin for the rest of the evening. Although I was somehow able to convince her that I was in no financial position to buy a ring (which was already being made), I was completely defeated. I knew there was no way I could suprise her with a Shasta visit without her knowing I was going to propose. I picked out the perfect ring. I was ready to ask the girl of my dreams to marry me and yet, all of a sudden, I had not a clue of how to propose. I started trying to come up with ideas of how I could propose, but nothing seemed special enough. Nothing I could come up with was perfect for us.
            </p>
            <p>Kaitlin's 3rd Annual Cousin's Christmas party was coming up and we had made the decision to have the party at our new place in Dublin. I was dating Kaitlin when they had their first annual so I had been fortunate enough to attend the first and only 2 that they had. The party was a white elephant gift exchange and they were an absolute blast. Everyone looked forward to going. One evening Kaitlin and I were talking about how we were going to organize and decorate for the party, when I realized how I was going to propose. I would have the ring inside one of the gifts for the white elephant gift exchange and I would make sure that I picked the gift. Coming up with the idea was the easy part, but to coordinate everthing, I was going to need a little bit of help.</p>
            <h4 class="wedding-topic">The Day of</h4>
            <p>On the day of the proposal I couldn't think about anything else. A pair of champange glasses, a very large rock, and some wrapping paper sat in the corner of my office as I thought about the moment I would propose. A million different circumstances were possible. What if she said no? I was a wreck.</p>
            <p>On my way home from work I started practicing what I was going to say when I proposed. My heart was pounding just imagining the moment. I got home and realized that I would have to wait at least another 3 or 4 hours until I would actually propose. I felt like I was going to die. The time dragged on and finally we were ready to pick numbers for the white elephant gift exchange.</p>
            <p>A few weeks back I had talked with Kaitlin's cousin Morgan about helping me rig the white elephant gift exchange. We decided it would be best for me to go 3rd and have her husband Mike, and her sister Jenna go right before me so they knew not to pick "the gift". I had Morgan bring in "the gift" from my car so she knew what it looked like. As everyone was about to pick the numbers out of a hat Morgan quickly turns to me and hands me the number 3. We all sat down in the living room and I made sure Kaitlin sat next to me closest to the Christmas tree. I wanted to make sure we got good pictures.</p><p>The next 10 minutes were a blur. I was so focused on my speech and proposing that couldn't even pay attention to what was happening. I looked up from my daze and it was my turn to pick a gift. I wandered around the Christmas tree listening to each person try to persuade me to pick a certain gift. I grabbed the gift and sat down next to Kaitlin. I pulled out the bottle of cheap Andres champange (Kaitlin's favorite) from the bag and grabbed the wrapped gift. I tore through the wrapping paper forgetting what was about to happen next. As soon as Kaitlin sees what the gift is, she tries to get me to put it aside so noone would try to steal it. I laughed and opened it anyway. I unwrapped one of the champange glasses that had the ring tucked underneath to show everyone. As I was showing the group Kaitlin noticed the box and went to reach for it. I quickly stood up and told the group that I had something important to say. I got down on one knee, saw Kaitlin's mouth drop and gave my speech. I showed her the ring and she jumped off the couch and leaped on me screaming out "YES!". I've never been so happy.</p>
